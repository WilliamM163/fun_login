# Fun Login: Snake Your Way In! üêç

## Project Description
Fun Login introduces a novel and engaging login system.
Instead of relying on traditional passwords, users authenticate by solving a unique, randomly generated snake game puzzle.
The specific sequence of moves a user takes to complete the game becomes their "password."
This adds a layer of fun and interactivity to the login process, making it more memorable and potentially more secure.

    * PostgreSQL

## Features
* **Unique Snake Game Passwords:** Each user's login sequence is determined by their solution to a randomly generated snake game.
* **Interactive and Engaging Login:** Replaces the mundane password entry with a fun and challenging game.
* **Secure Authentication:** The complexity of snake game solutions provides a potentially strong authentication method.
* **User Registration and Profile:** Standard user registration and profile management.

## Setup Instructions
1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WilliamM163/fun_login
    cd fun_login
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Node.js/Express.js):**

    * Navigate to the `server` directory:

        ```bash
        cd server
        ```

    * Install dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

    * Create a `.env` file and copy variables below
      ```.env
      DB_USER=<your_postgres_user_name>
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_DATABASE=fun_login
      DB_PASSWORD=<your_postgres_user_password>
      DB_PORT=<5432 or your_postgres_port>
      JWT_SECRET=<secret>
      JWT_EXPIRY=1h
      SERVER_PORT=3000
      ```
        * replace variables like postgres_username to variables unique to your machine
        * generate a secure string for the JWT_SECRET.
        * to generate a secret you can use the following JS code
      ```bash
      node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'));"
      ```

    * Initializing the database tables
        ```bash
        psql -U [your_postgresql_username] -d [your_postgresql_database_name] -f setup.sql
        ```

    * Start the backend server:

        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (React):**

    * Navigate to the `client` directory:

        ```bash
        cd client
        ```

    * Install dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

    * Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the following environment variable:

        ```
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
        ```

    * Start the frontend development server:

        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

4.  **Database Setup (PostgreSQL):**

    * Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
    * Create a database with the name specified in your `.env` file.
    * Ensure your postgres user has the correct permissions.
